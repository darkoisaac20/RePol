"expensive junk: this product consists of a piece of thin flexible insulating material, adhesive backed velcro and white electrical tape.problems:0. instructions are three pictures with little more information.0. velcro was all crumpled as received and was stronger than the adhesive. when i tried to disengage the velcro both pieces came off and the paint from the ceiling.0. white electrical tape was horrible... cheap, narrow and it fell off in less than 0 hour.0. the price is a ripoff.i am building my own which is easier to use, cheaper, more attractive, and higher r-value. i am surprised amazon even lists this junk.",negative
"toast too dark: even on the lowest setting, the toast is too dark for my liking. also, the on light stays lit so you have to unplug it to avoid wasting electricity. not the quality i expected from cuisinart.",negative
excellent imagery...dumbed down story: i enjoyed this disc. the video is stunning. i agree with others that the story is very dumbed down and takes a childish approach. it actually seems like its a little one sided and very pro-environmental. nevertheless its enjoyable. i would say however that the amazon wmv hd disc is a better story and has better and sharper images and more interesting things to look at.,positive
"are we pretending everyone is married?: the authors pretend that parents neither die nor divorce. insisting the marriage is the rock upon which all else (behavior, well-being of the child) is built, they send a clear message to non-traditional households: this book is for people who play the game of life our way only, and everyone else can suffer the bad behavior they deserve to.",negative
"not worth your time: might as well just use a knife, this product holds next to nothing. i found it to be a useless product.",negative
"book reads like written for grade schoolers: i think that the whole aspect of hitting the road and going on tour with a band is just about the coolest thing that a person can do. thus, this book seemed like the perfect read for someone like me. but when i got the book i was dissapointed in the fact that it seems like the author took five or six stories from the 'the babysiters club' or some other book for young kids, rewrote them to include drug and music references, and than sold it. the writing is just not very good and the stories are all lame. a girl's mother realizes her 00 year old daughter is right about being on tour, a girl runs from the cops and gets away, a ticket is fake, ect. those in themselves aren't even that bad but the way he writes makes it a boring read.",negative
"jeanne de florette & manon of the springs: i saw these movies originally in the theater, loved both and ordered them because i wanted to have it in my collection. i ordered it twice and neither of the dvds worked. i would think you would check your merchandise before sending it out. i am so disappointed and can't believe that you could send out two defective dvds and had not solved the problem after the first one plus some of the complaints i have read in the reviews. i am rating this with one star because of the quality of the dvd, not the films.colleen",negative
"theater projector ceiling mount: would not fit my new optima hd00 projector -- as projectors get smaller the mounting holes get closer together -- this mount had four arms and the projector had three -- the mount had arms that would not get short enough to reach the three projector holes -- for larger projectors may work better, but for mine would not recommend -- returning it was very easy and the company representatives very helpful -- so if you get it and it doesn't work, the company is easy to work with --",negative
"this import is sooooooooooo good: this is a great cd!!!!!!!!! it is the normal oops! cd plus three cool new songs. also there are lots of added extras that are inhansed on the cd, for example you get the lucky video, a fact file, and a britney unscrambler!!!!! the three bonus tracks are really nice but i wish that they could have been a little more up tempo. just to clear something up it says in the discription that there is an exclusive oops preformance but there isn't!",positive
"garbage: the handle broke clean off after two weeks. not the plastic part, actually at the weld where the metal meets the pan. wasn't overheated, wasn't abused, used 0 times and broke.",negative
"amazing, fascinating: this was a stunning book. well written, packed with fascinating detail, i wish i had ten more like it to turn to. anyone looking for an inside view of a part of china's history would do well to pick up this book. it was a wonderful read.",positive
"not great: this book just gives you the basics unfortunately. was not very helpful, i would suggest just doing research on the interweb instead.",negative
superficial fluff: this book does not convey much of anything. save your time and money. read searching for bobby fischer. the details and honesty are lacking in this made for mtv summary of kindergartener makes good.,negative
"great album - some serious stuff: first off, i've bought all of tonis other albums. this one took me three listenings to really get to like it. when i found out that it was about a child being born and how her life progressed, i found the work all the more interesting. some of the songs really stick in your mind. if you see the album as a story (of a girls life) it makes the album much more interesting than just listening to the album song by song.pink floyd used to do this, have an album which was a theme or story, like the wall album.i took the cd out of my colection after not listening to it for about 0 months, and have been playing it in my car on the way to work and home for over a week now.it's great. and i'm not a female by the way.nice album. if you like tonis other works,.....get it.",positive
"good quality, but high shipping charge: the scratch resistant screen guard protector is fit perfectly on the screen of htc cingular 0000. quality of the screen guard protector is very good. only negative point is high shipping charge. it cost me $0.00 as shipping for buying this item which cost $ 0.00 amazon has to reduce the shipping charge, or reduce the shipping charge for combined items. any way best buy.",positive
couldn't even finish it.: i couldn't even finish the book. i got about half way through and realized i wasn't paying attention and didn't care. nothing like harry potter - not fun at all. i can't recommend this at all!,negative
great choice for bedtime or anytime!: we were given this book as a shower gift before our kids were born and i was somewhat skeptical but it has turned out to be a favorite. our daughter loves to name the animals and their sounds and has learned her colours from these wonderful books. the pictures are just right as is the wonderful text that is just enough repetition that she 'gets it' to participate with the reading. a great asset to your children's library... or shower gift for those people who have everything already!,positive
"fun for all ages!: having received this video as a gift, we watched it as a family, accompanied by a lot of laughter and ""i didn't know that"". the kids managed to show this to most of their friends, the youngest even taking it to school where his 0st grade teacher used it as a part of her unit on careers.the video is an overall winner. anyone, any age, will enjoy the playful and informative story and all will come away with a greater understanding and respect for both the lobster and the lobsterman. buy it!",positive
contemplating marriage...a must read.: this book is used by many marriage counselors. but i believe if you are getting married this book should be required reading. it provides true insight to what makes us tick and how to keep the fire burning bright which should be every expecting to be couple's heart desire.,positive
"ran the stoplight?: listened to this cd closely for the first time in a while. i've forgotten how outstanding this cd is. while i have not heard pure, i have ordered it hoping it that will be anything close to this cd - and hopefully far away from dead inside which is a whole different planet. great vocals, great music, great lyrics, it has it all.",positive
"excelente compilaci√≥n de lo mejor de caifanes: debido a los otros comentarios al respecto de este disco quiero aclarar que caifanes no es lo mismo que jaguares. son dos grupos diferentes ya que en caifanes la guitarra estaba en primer plano. el unico pero que le pongo a este cd es que solo incluyeron 0 canciones del mtv unplugged. me hubiera gustado que incluyeran todo el mtv unplugged en el segundo disco. las guitarras de marcovich se aprecian mas en las versiones en vivo ya que existe la certeza de que no hay ""overdubbing"" (regrabaciones). un buen disco para empezar. estoy seguro que si este es el primer disco de caifanes que se adquiere pronto nacera la curiosidad por conocer las canciones que no se incluyen de los otros discos.",positive
not prepared as an ebook: this book has two stories writen at the same time. in the original pbook format one story was written in left pages and the other in the right pages. but this is all lost in the kindle and its very complicated to follow the story. i can not uderestand how they dare to sell a product not propared to be used properlly by its readers.,negative
"thanks for the 0000s home movie ken burns: the documentary is typical ken burns... interesting, but a little meandering at times.the real shame of this version is the grainy video that is painfully apparent on a large hd display. burns' panned still images are crystal clear showing every blemish and fold of the old photographs but his shots of the majestic scenery in the parks are marred by his poor choice of camera and film. i will say the soundtrack is fairly well done even if peter coyote (narrator) is a little dry.do not bother with the blu ray version, you will not get anything more than the standard dvd version with this series.",negative
"not nearly as good as the first series: this book is nowhere near as good as the the first series! it seriosly lacks exement!in other words don't buy it, if you really want to read it, get it from the libray. i would not recomend it to anybody.",negative
"harrison ford at his very best! witness rules!: ""witness"" is about ford and an amish boy who witnesses a murder. now, the amish don't beleive in killing and guns - and to have their child see that sort of stuff is just terrible. now, men who were involved in the murder are out to murder the amish boy! suspenseful and red - blooded, ""witness"" is an awsome film! i loved it and i bet anyone will, too! enjoy!",positive
"excellently drawn characters: nina's characters are complex and drawn well, it is evident that she took some time to think about her character's motivations. if i were a writer i might have written the ending differently, but that is okay, my book club talked about this one for awhile. a good exploration of the line between admiring someone and stalking and a bold exploration of the dark side of behavior. if you are looked for a well plotted, interesting story, this is for you. it is not one of those books with lots of sex and no plot as you might think at first. i was pleasantly surprised and look forward to whatever ms. foxx has up her sleeve next.",positive
it's nice: i've saved a lot of space by hanging my shoes up with this. for heavier shoes you have to use more than one hanger though,positive
"one of the best albums i've owned.: a few years back my father got me hooked on this album. it was the first cd i ever owned. an ex-girlfriend liked it so much that after we broke up she declared that cd was not coming with me.i couldn't blame her. the mix of blues and spirituals with cooder's unique playing makes this one the most intesting albums i own. the medley of ""feeling good"" and ""fool for a cigarette"" is one of my favorites as well as balads like ""mexican divorce"" and ""jesus on the main line"".the album also has some songs that keep it from taking itself too seriously. the song ""if walls could talk"" has a catchy riff and great words.cooder's great acoustic style shines through on what was a break-through album of the time and holds up years later. i always hear something that i missed on previous listenings.although you don't need to be a guitar player to appreciate this album, every acoustic player should hear the fine guitar work. enjoy!",positive
great for making dough: i ordered this bread machine for a vacation home that we own. i have a cuisinart at my year-round home and it just has too many bells and whistles that i never use - and cost a lot more. the sunbeam makes a great dough and was a great price.,positive
"mac owners beware: my wife purchased a rocket ebook for me for christmas. she started here at amazon. she carefully checked the rocket web site as well, and spoke to the folks that make the rocket. she was assured that everything required to use the rocket with a mac was included. wrong! any mac currently being made or made during the past year or so requires a keyspan connector between the e-book and the mac usb slot. this costs $00. it is not mentioned in any documentation that comes with the ebook. it took me more than an hour to get through to the company. at first they responded by saying it was at their website and/or in the faq section, but we ""went to their web site together"" while i was on the phone, and they reluctantly conceded that they had mislead the public. the company does literature. guide provided on the ebook. regardless of how much i may eventually enjoy this toy, i'll never develop a high regard for nuvomedia, which makes the rocket ebook.",negative
"a disaster one month at a time: upon receipt it was dead, after a mixture of e-mailes and phone calls it was determined i needed to use 0 usb cables to power the drive. since i only have 0 on my laptop, i cant print from the drive. after transfering 00 gig of pictures and 00 gig of mp0's the unit failed the next month. again emails and phone calls determined my laptop did not have enough power to run the drive. the solution was an ac adapter.....great for a ""portable usb drive"" they said an ac adaptor would be sent...no adapter after 0 weeks now. i tried the drive on 0 other desktops, plenty of usb power, but no luck. i have lost so much information, pictures, and music and now no emails refering to my ""service number"" are being answered at all.a total lack of customer servive and knolage of their own product. think long and hard before dealing with iogear!!",negative
"junk: i just got my dvd in today and i tried to watch it but there seems to be nothing on both discs, i have tried it in my dvd player and my computer, nothing is on both discs, nothing will load, i got robbed.if there were something on both discs, i'd give it a high rating, but for now, all i'll give is one star.",negative
it is fun and a nice car: it is a nice car - better than a already made car - your son will have fun assemble it will even do some changes and when he finish he can continue playing as if it were a standard car.,positive

excellent: all of james patterson's books (women's murder club) have kept me in suspense. i would be glad to say that it have been a thrill to read them,positive
everyone needs to let it go!: i'm sick of everyone saying ashlee has no talent. if she had no talent she wouldn't have a record deal. she is only 00 and talks about 00 year old things. people seem to forget that she has been on tv for 0 years and that is why people already know her. i appreciate her music b/c it is her music. she's more than many musicians today-she's writing the lyrics rather than singing other people's songs. the album is good. quit putting her down and appreciate her for her hard work! she sings a lot better than other musicians you all like!,positive
"not even ok.: i'm a pilot, and i'm giving up on this product. i've been trying to use it, calibrate it, get it to respond somewhat close to the way a real aircraft responds, and it just doesn't work. it is possible i'm doing something wrong, but it should not take several hours of trying to figure out the right way. i've reduced sensitivity to zero and it still won't respond realistically.",negative
"one minute to zero: movie had a great story, but filming methods of that time was not that great. i enjoyed the movie mostly because i had met the stars when they were in colorado springs during the filming of some of the movie.i purchased this movie from amazon.",negative
just like when i was a kid!: i bought this for my daughter when she was almost 0yrs. and she loved it from the start. the music is a little annoying but that is my problem not hers. she has stood on top of it and it has been dropped down the stairs and it still works fine!i would definalty reccomend this toy!,positive
disappointed:: i was disappointed with this book. since it said hallelujah on the cover i though it was raw food recipes. i will be giving it away for a gift when i need something for a gift the next time.this book should of never been put with the hallelujah diet book.,negative
"this muse is a slumber!: actually, i thought i had ordered the cd of the tv show. unfortunately, it wasn't. amazom staff admitted that the pics on the sell page were misleading. we've listened and it's not worth much. curious how a tv sound track can be so engaging and another cd so trite and shallow. buyer beware.",negative
"not necessary.: i bought this neck strap with my camera, thinking i would be insane not to have a strap to put around my neck.i learned, however, that it really isn't necessary. the elphs are so tiny that they easily fit into your pocket. the other option is to wind the included wrist strap around your wrist. they're so lightweight that you barely notice they're there.",negative
"men with brooms: if you love the sport of curling, do not watch this movie! the acting is just okay. don't let your kids watch this movie as there is a lot of profanity in it. the movie isn't awful, but it isn't good either. the curling action is not realistic.",negative
"works great for me: after my last panasonic shaver mysteriously disappeared when i moved across the country, i decided to try this one, since the price was so cheap i wouldn't be kicking myself if the other shaver is rediscovered in a moving box somewhere. i have been very pleased with it, and love shaving in the shower with it. like others, i have found that the neck area requires a little more attention and a few extra passes to get the job done, but well worth it for a close shave with no bleeding. it took over a month for the product to be delivered from amazon, since they were out of stock when i ordered.",positive

"lost: a friend gave me a copy of ""dresden"" and i watched it many times before giving it back and ordering my own copy. i watched the movie several times for different reasons: 0. history, 0. view from the german side, 0. view from the british side, 0. acting skills. i love the movie, am impressed with f. woll's in the main role. i think some scenes were too hollywood, loved the honesty of the script, not too much violence, but one can start to feel the horror of the bombings and being trapped in cellars and on the ground by the devastating fires. i was a mistake, a big one, history was destroyed as it often is in wars. did the germans deserve this so much emotionally human reaction? yes and no. not only the germans or the people of dresden lost a jewel.",positive
"lame: i agree with the kids review below. this album along with all of their others is garbage. they just keep putting out the same album over and over.do you really think in 00, 00, even 00 years, people are going to be playing nickelback cds and saying, ""wow they were a great band""? who goes around blasting creed, poison, cinderella, ratt, or c&c; music factory? this band will be forgotten just like these others.it's textbook rock ballad garbage with no thought or feeling put into the song writing. they have found a formula that somehow sells records and so they've stuck with it. watch their live performances with chad's gay permed haircut. someone should take their instruments away so they won't poison rock music anymore.",negative
"great movie!: this is the epitome of a ""b"" western movie, but it's hilarious! andy griffith, tom berrenger, marilou henner and selma ward--all of them did a great job on this!",positive
"yummy!: these are individually wrapped and there are approximately 00 cookies in each box. they have a nice flavor and are fresh and crispy. the fortunes are standard fortune cookie fare. very few of these were broken during shipping. i definitely recommend these if you like fortune cookies. they are a low-calorie, low-fat snack. yummy!",positive
"great speaker package for the money!: polk audio rm0000 0.0 channel home theater speaker system, black finishi have been using this speaker system for about a year with a sony str-dg000. i am very pleased with the performance of this package especially at the price point. my friends and family have all been impressed remarking that the system sounds like a movie theater. bass from sub-woofer is deep and powerful and the center speaker reproduces dialoge beautifully. what is also nice, polk sells seperate surround speakers so i can make a 0.0 system since my sony receiver has that capability. don't worry if you are thinking about rm0000, i have enjoyed mine from the start!",positive
"misleading specs: va 0/0 inch rotaty files and rasps are not 0/0 inch in diameter. they can be up to 0/00 smaller depending on product number. ie: 00000 is labeled 00.0 mm, yet va's spec is 00.0 mm, and 00000 is labeled 00.0 mm, yet va's spec is 00.0 mm",negative
"kfm: i first saw kentucky fried movie when i was 00 years old. i am now 00. a friend of mine mentioned a line from the movie and it was so funny that i went online to buy this movie to show my son and also to see it again with my friends now. it is made up of little skits that are all funny. maybe a little silly also, but still a good movie to hang out and watch.",positive
"funkin amazing and out there: like strayhorn and the duke, gil really found someone he could bounce off in the shape of brian jackson. his earlier stuff is pure gold, but very droney sometimes... but this!!!this i never tire of. the songs still sound so vibrant and fresh.the live version of 'home is where the hatred is' has been sampled by masters @ work, and is a muso's dream to get into.'hello sunday hello road is one of the grooviest tracks around, and you just can fail to move along and understand the message of 'it's your world.' my mum used to have the lp, secrets, with the cats face on the cover. angel dust is a spacey reincarnation of whats it's like to trip out on the stuff, and the lyrics to showbusiness are more relevent today than ever before.this is one of the best and most valuble compilations of gils to come out, and is an essential purchase for and funkster and poet.",positive
"great art, great action: jedis are great and all, but i really enjoy the war aspect of this series. vol 0 was good, vol 0 started really picking up in the last section, and vol 0 really gets to it--war! its the volumes like this one that make me wish they had a series devoted to clone troopers, republic commandos, and arcs (esp alpha). good inking and artwork. straight-forward plot, almost near constant action, and it was good to see the republic actually defeated here. nice character development for anakin. this volume has been my favorite so far...looking forward to getting vol 0.",positive
"good for stretching, not to get a workout.: i've been to yoga classes where you get more of a workout than this one. this is more like a stretching exercise. my complaint is a lot of the stretches seemed to repeat many times. the equipment required for use to follow the exercise like the block, straps are kinda specialised items you'd have to buy. i tried to substitue with items i can find at home like a step stool, and rope.for a real workout, i prefer the perfect pregnancy workout dvd with karyne steben.",negative
"terrible acting: this movie could have been good, but the acting was so bad i turned it off after 00 minutes (i can't even believe i watched it that long) i was hoping something would change, the plot was a good, but could not even get into any of the characters. i don't recommend this movie.",negative

"amazing first single!!!: the first single from this album is called ""through the rain"". it's like old mariah only even better. this is a beautiful ballad which has a similiar theme to ""hero"" or ""can't take that away"", but is even more incredible. if you liked ""old"" mariah, you will want this album. she does have rappers on it, but they aren't the main focus. it's such a beatiful song and i have heard soooooooooo many good things about this album ~ and not just from fans but from critics too! go to her official site to listen to through the rain <url>",positive
"awkward and trite, too many cliches for me.: while the subject matter of ""the last dive"" is compeling enough to carry its own story line, the author's attempts to interject contrived dialogue is embarrasing and a deteriment to his otherwise skillfull writing. chowdhury would have been well advised to simply tell the story and not try to animate it with guessed-at dialogue. i came away disliking the ""cowboy-like"" father and son diving team and their tragic demise came as no surprise. chowdhury's techincal explanations and descrption of the history of the sport are very good. unfortunately his fictionalizing of the varous conversations is more cartoon than clever.",negative
"what a pervert!: this was a horrible book!anthony is a sadistic pedophiliac who had been ""watching [the heroine] from afar"". he had even gone so far as to have her tutored in a language he wanted her to speak.it sickened me that the character was made to fall in love with her rapist.""love"" does not justify rape or whipping a woman or any of the other sick things in this book.",negative
"mitusmi extrenal usb floppy drive: the unit itself seems to be a good unit. however... it is a terrible device for using in windows 0 pro. there are no drivers for it, and you can't not get customer support to answers to your correspondence, for it. so if your going to try to use it in windows 0... for now, for get it.",negative
"my dog's favorite toy by far!: i bought the duck for my 0 pound poodle and it became his favorite toy. the sound of the duck scared him though, but the great part is if they don't like it you can just remove it and they still love just the plush toy. it's perfect for even the smallest dogs and can easily be carried around and played with. the design makes it easy for small dogs to get their mouths around to pick up. i would not recommend this for very destructive dogs though as the limbs might get torn off.",positive
"romantic rape?: i enjoy romance novels. i do not enjoy reading about a woman who is abducted, continually raped, impregnated, and then falls in love with her rapist. i kept reading hoping that he would get his just dessert. but he didn't. she falls in love with him and he gets ""reformed."" ????? the whole time all i could think was--this is called stockholm syndrome! i was horrified that this was considered a romance. the rape scenes were graphic and, in many cases, violent.johanna lindsey should be ashamed of herself for making rape romantic. it is horrible. do not read!!!",negative
"did not live up to the hype; not even close.: i really was disappointed in this book. with all the hype i expected it to be filled with revolutionary ideas and recipes for totally green smoothies. there are a few interesting details such as the thought that our diet should more closely resemble chimps. basically we should eat more greens. other than that much of it is hard to believe. there is absolutely no way all those people (first name only) were cured of illnesses by drinking one quart of green smoothies. sorry... but no way. please, moles and warts just fell off.... that kind of claim is a total turn off. the recipes are plain old one cup of greens with fruit and ice. so basically eating one cup of spinach a day, ground up, will cure diabetes? way over rated. i read it in one night and it is definitely not something i would want to keep as a reference for anything. get it out of the library.",negative
"it's the unthinkable!: the only reason that i am giving 0 stars is because the author did not list all the victims of dr. shipman's unsuspected reign of terror in lancashire. in his long career, he probably killed at least 000 victims--men, women, children, for no apparent reason until he was stopped by the law. sadly, i cannot stop thinking about all the victims who had dreams to see israel, cruise, grow up, or old with their loved ones in lancashire. dr. shipman was supposed to be respected and trusted with their lives; he killed his beloved patients without such motives at all. the book is an easy read unless you're trying to find out the victims and give them a proper memorial. this book is for those victims and their families! maybe we can learn from what happened in lancashire!",positive
"love him but this a terrible movie: the characters never really fully develop and, it's a dark miserable story with people running, crying, screaming, at times you need to stop and say to yourself what's going on. i felt nothing for him as a character neither did i feel anything for any of them, i wasn't socked i was bored.it's ok to watch on an airplane ride so you can fall asleep...from 0 to 00 i give a 0",negative
"great for baby bonding, bad for sids aspect.: i was very excited about this book, until my baby died of sids. i think it has some great info. on breastfeeding, etc., but the chapter on sids is simply incorrect.the author, like dr. sears, is a huge bed sharing advocate. the us comsumer product safety commission, just concluded a 0 year study that strongly advises against bed sharing to reduce sids. the american academy of pediactrics and us public health svc. back up this study. since our loss, it's important to me that the correct info. gets circulated. see the sids alliance web page for more information about sids.",negative

"very helpful.: i ordered this to accompany the pimsleur language russian program, as pimsleur, although very powerful for learning to speak, has little more than a pamphlet to teach you to read. so, i picked this up, and it is very handy. it has made the process of learning to read fairly easay and enjoyable.i would have rated this a 0, however, because you lose a lot of the meat of the book if you don't have the audio recordings, which aren't included in the book. at least, they weren't with mine. however, i poked around online and found that they're available for download off this <url>i don't know how long that site will be up, but if you intend to use this book to teach yourself to read and speak, those mp0s will be invaluable.",positive
"not as it looks!: heart pendant does not look as pretty as in the picture, there's this gold topaz covering on both sides that totally ruins the look of the normal swarovski crystal, in other words, no colors shine at all. same thing in on other sites for like $0. speedy delivery was the only positive.",negative
"i like it!!!: i love the compactness of this waterpik. i had the larger one and this one is far more convenient. you don't have to invert the reservoir and the power of the jet is actually stronger than the bigger model. granted, the smaller amount of liquid in the reservoir was a little disappointing, but i just keep another cup ready to refill it while i am still using the pik. it is definitely easy to use and, of course, that means it will be used more often and the check ups at the dentist attest to the positive impact it has. i most often use a salt & warm water solution and it works great.",positive
"this book is the worst i've read.: i make candles and export them for a living. i read a lot of wax candle and gel candle making books ... ! it doesn't fit for anyone one at all, be it an amateur or an intermediate level crafter. believe me, it's best for you to avoid buying this book. it's not worth your money and time reading.",negative

"huge letdown: i can't understand all of the good reviews for this film, which i found to be a huge disappointment. bad performances, coupled with awful direction and hackneyed, cliched writing puts this on my list of films to avoid. the film obviously tried to capitalize on muniz's rising star power among youngsters and families, but offered little substance for this film to endure. there is never an indication at what makes this dog so special. and it' hard to believe that only two dogs were used for skip; his appearance changes quite frequently throughout the film.if you want a recent ""uplifting"" family film, opt for ""the sandlot.""",negative

"absolute garbage: there are many things wrong with this keyboard, in the first that it's a novel concept, and was directed to be a 'keyboard' marketed towards gamers. i fell for the advertising and spent the first few hours messing with the various configurations and being in awe of the keymapping, but in the end you are still left with a very sub-par product - a rubber dome based keyboard, with folding gimmick top half.it would constantly disconnect from the computer, the drivers had to be reinstalled for it to respond again, it didn't exactly 'work' during bootup other, which forced me to fetch an older keyboard and use that to install windows..overall a very shoddy product. if you want a solid gaming keyboard for your money that won't die on you every 00 minutes after two days of ownership, strongly consider a das keyboard. it's what i'm writing this review on right now, and i've owned it for more than a year, a long time after i've thrown away the worthless zboard as well.",negative

"like nothing else...: except maybe jeanette winterson's ""written on the body."" i felt deeply pulled in by this novel, which unfolds slowly and bathes you in an incredibly intoxicating, emotional mist. it is highly erotic and engrossing, and one of the only well written and overtly bisexual works of fiction. the only failure here is the ending which becomes a little too melodramatic and (i think) untrue to at least one of the characters. but the quality of language, plot, and character are very, very high. i took it in while i was recovering from a break-up and the relationships in searle's book were enough to distract me. i consider it my rebound (without the consequences). please read this book.",positive

"works fine, auto shut-off a big plus: this coffeemaker works well. it is inexpensive, easy to fill, easy to clean and fairly fast. the only minor drawback is the lack of an externally visible fill level. the internal fill mark is just about impossible to see, so you really have to measure the water you put in. the automatic shut-off is a big plus. i previously had a similar toastess model (toastess tfc-000 personal-size 0-cup coffeemaker, black) which was also a good coffeemaker. it had an external fill indicator, but it lacked the automatic shut-off. i kept forgetting to turn it off after making coffee, which probably contributed to its early demise.",positive
"english subtitles, please?: i am about 00 minutes into this documentary and find that my interest in watching further is seriously challenged by my inability to understand what the three remaining brothers are talking about. three middle-aged fellows muttering into their beards or to their feet or to the middle distance do not make riveting storytelling, if one has no idea what they are saying in their country accents. my enjoyment and understanding would be enhanced 000% if there were subtitles. it's not too late to reach a wider audience....",negative
fantastic product!: bought this for my boss who uses 0 hearing aids. he absolutely loves it and it does not interfere with his hearing aids. the volume control is excellent and you don't need to use it on the highest setting it is so powerful. you can also adjust it to accomodate the pitch of different voices. would highly recommend this product for those who cannot hear well.,positive

"very dated material: the q&a approach adopted in this book is very useful. it would provide for a very useful reference manual on m&a if its content were not so dated. its discussion of taxes, accounting, and deal structures does not reflect recent changes in rules and m&a practices. it would be helpful if the author would update the material. other more current and more comprehensive books on the subject that i have found useful include mergers, acquisitions, and other restructuring activities by depamphilis and bruner's m&a book.",negative

(the lame bot matches and training missions don't count) i mean for crying out loud, even halo and gears of war had memorable storys and characters. and those were based on brand new ideas ad licenses. its not that the gameplay is bad. the multi-player is actually very well thought out. but for a game that costs us 00 dollars, there is absolutly no excuse for no story mode. i'm not even going to start on the lack of maps.

"a highly detailed look at honda motorcycle history: many books on motorcycles abound with glossy pictures but contain little facts. this slim volume by roland brown is quite the reverse. the majority of photos are original b&ws, not staged fashion shots, and there is ample text. it is not a coffee table book, it is a real book! the history begins with soichiro honda's start after wwii and traces the company's progress to 0000. for the real motorcyclist there is plenty of technical detail which is used to show the evolution from one machine to the next, rather than being just tabulated facts. the story of the development of motorcycles, as we now know them, and the fascinating saga of a multinational company's growth, make excellent reading. my only complaint is that a book this slim (000 small pages), really doesn't warrant a price tag of $00. never the less, i still bought it, and was glad i did.",positive

"a little disappointed: i was a little disappointed that the book did not elaborate a little more on the specific cases cited as examples. most of the time it just indicates if a particular case either set a precedent or was a counter-example to a precendent, and then gives a footnote reference to legal documents. the book reads too much like a synopsis of a legal library. when statistics is discussed, it is an elementary exposition of basic concepts. what i wanted was lucid examples of how these basic concepts actually made a difference in legal cases. i did not get that from this book. this was the first book on statistics and law that i bought and read, so i don't know how to compare it to others. but i will select and try another to see if what i am looking for is out there.",negative

"good idea, ineptly done: i'd never read sandra brown, and, based on ""the switch,"" won't look to read more.a potentially interesting plot was ruined by ludicrous dialogue, unbelievable characters, and extremely unlikely plot twists (even allowing for the initial premise). and anyone who was surprised by the ending ought to be ashamed.no, wait. that's not true. readers who thought early on that they had spotted the ending were encouraged to think otherwise by the fact that in several places brown refers specifically to melina out of the context of a conversation. e.g. on page 000 a new chapter section begins: melina repeated to chief the half of the conversation that he hadn't overheard. well, it wasn't melina, we find at the end, so brown effectively set up a climax, as it were, that made no sense.too bad. identical twins can make for interesting reading, but they don't make the grade here.",negative
"actually it should be no stars: i have only written reviews for books i have genuinely liked. this is the first time i have written a ""don't buy this book"" warning. buy it used or get it from the library if you must read it. but it is a plotless waste of time and i am more sorry about that than i can say.",negative
"i didn't believe you. it works!: i saw this product in a pet store and decided to go online to read the online reviews of the product before i actually bought it. all the reviews were surprisingly positive so i figured i'd try it - why not? at least, i could listen to it and relax even if the animals didn't. well! my two dogs (a shep mix and an akita mix) and the two cats were actually listening and then they went to sleep! it really did calm them down!",positive
cheap: this product is cheap. it looks cheap and i am sure it is not very durable. i should have spent a little more to get better quality but thought i was getting a good deal. the only use i may get out of these is to save them for a camping trip or inclement weather. maybe they can protect the new mats i will be ordering.,negative

"waste of money: i was very eager to buy this cd. i have the cd elixir and i love it. i saw and heard fourplay in atlanta and they were awesome. however, this cd has too much computerized music. too many sythensized voices. very predictable. in my estimation, a bunch of tracks to play on smooth jazz radio stations or in an elevator as mindless filler. i didn't care for this one at all.",negative

"best -and only- book of its kind: it's an enormous improvement from the second edition, which i also own a copy of. the book covers everything you need to know to pass state and national board examinations and become a licensed dispensing optician. my only complaints are that its contents are ordered somewhat counterintuitively, and that it's a very large, heavy volume (i have enough to tote around with my tools!)",positive

"difficult to read: a good way to describe this book might be to say that it is what /reminiscence of a stock operator/ would have been like had philip roth written it.many times while i was reading this, i had to look at the back cover and reread ace greenberg's quote: ""buzzy schwartz is a winner....all else is nonsense."" because this book is so full of insipid nonsense, you might forget schwartz is, in fact, a winner.i suggest checking it out at the library and reading only the last two chapters, which actually have something in them that could be called ""lessons"". (please note the title of this book.) forget the rest, it's nonsense. like many other reviewers here have said, there is no system on a silver platter. take what you can find and do your own research.whatever you decide, realize that no great trader would ever ""need"" this book, certainly not for its ""psychological insights"". buzzy wouldn't have, at least.",negative

"better than the movie: hampton sides' telling of the rescue of 000 pows, survivors of the infamous bataan death march, by u.s. army rangers in the philippines during the waning days of world war ii is an outstanding job of reportage. sides tells the story from the eyes of the rescued and their rescuers, building suspense that wasn't always present in the the great raid, the film adaptation of his story. as a working journalist for more than 00 years, i know i good story when i read one, and this one falls into that category.",positive

"a very good solo raider entry: ""death's deal"" is a fine entry in the solo raider western novel series. this series of books focused on the character of raider, working alone for the pinkertons after doc weatherbee leaves the agency.most of the plot is taken up with a grueling cattle drive, which brings out the courage and cowardice, good and evil of everybody involved. the major villain is more of a contemporary sociopath than the standard western bad guy.the solo raider books just don't have the quality of the earlier hardin series, but this one is excellent.highly recommended.",positive

"is there a half star option: great firelighter.i picked up this book at the same time as i picked up the forgotten soldier by guy sajer, thinking that both were non-fiction accounts. boy was i wrong.what i don't understand is what possessed the author into thinking he had a novel in him? someone deluded him horribly. the book is at times unreadable for any number of reasons. it is unbelievable nonsense, terribly written and edited, and historically inaccurate to the point of being laugh out loud stupid. which is what i must have been for purchasing it without spotting that bulge of one star reviews.the book is very well reviewed by the authors friends and family and some people who owe him money and that is all.",negative
"great new band - rossdale still has it!!!: i was a huge fan of bush and now am a fan of institute. it does sound similar to bush, but probably because gavin rossdale writes all the lyrics and sings all the lead vocals. it has a harder edge than bush did, but overall i'm glad its similar.i was sad to see bush break up and am now glad to have another oppotunity to enjoy gavin's incredible voice and interesting lyric style.if you liked bush, you should enjoy this album.",positive
"an underrated guilty pleasure: although critically slashed upon its release it's actually a broad, very entertaining comedy with many funny sequences and performances. tom hanks and bruce willis are strangely miscast but are by no means bad. de palma's direction is as stylish as ever and the cinematography is quite beautiful. worth seeing for the eye-popping camerawork in opening five minutes alone. had this been an original adaption the critical concensus would have been far better.the dvd offers a nice anamorphic widescreen transfer and no other extras but for the low price it's great.",positive
"horrible: this is one of the worst surf movies ever! i mean all of the footage comes from other surf movies that are much much better, and it does not go into enough depth about the strapped crew. it says that laird hamilton and dave kalama are the onlt two apart of the crew, but there are about 00 more surfers in the actual crew. i have to say that also the guy who made this film did not do it very well. i mean you would expect bruce browns's son to make a better surf movie than this.

"victorinox vs leatherman: i have been a long time user of many tools from both companies and appreciate both of them equally. i mainly purchased this tool because i had not had a leatherman in a long time.another reason for going with this tool is i needed something i could carry in my pocket clipped. my victorinox swisstool spirit doesn't have a clip on it and i'm not one to carry a pouch on my belt just to carry my tool. i have to dress professional at work and having a tool clipped inside my pocket is a little more subtle in my opinion.it has a different feel than my swiss but i can already see how amazing it will be. the swiss is beautiful, well layed out, smooth, and shiny where the leatherman charge tti just looks mean. the blades on the leatherman are wicked and the best they offer. tools are a bit more out of the way but i love the one hand operation blades that i don't get on anything victorinox that i have.",positive

"undiluted truth, a molotov cocktail -: this book is like a bible for dissidents. i've felt mentally and morally sick working in higher education for close to ten years now and just thought i was crazy. gatto confirms that it is the system itself which is sick and that the people who run it and benefit are not honest and honorable people and one could fairly label them pathological, i'll even label them as pedophiles for raping the minds, spirits and souls of students. it's rare to see a man speak so truthfully and forcefully and passionately about what is missing today; honor, principle, character, creativity, imagination, independence, and dissent. i'm amazed this man hasn't been assassinated for exposing this dirty game. this book goes way beyond the narrow scope of education, he taps into a world view and value system which is heartening for me, he helps me understand why and how the world is so screwed up. this man should run for president in my opinion",positive

"classicly lovely and great for baby's vision: not only is this a simple, timeless, unisex looking mobile, but it is also great for the development of a baby's vision. whereas some mobiles function moreso to match decor, other mobiles are educational attachments to the crib. keep in mind that pastel colors are not appreciated by infants for months. the panda bear was the first animal seen by my infant b/c of the black and white. the primary colors of blue jean teddy then become noticed. the green gingham pattern on the dog and the softer hued duck were spotted after further development. my baby is now a sitter and she still likes to look at the panda the most. the only con of this mobile is the wind-up music box. i would have preferred a battery-operated one so that it can play as long as i and my baby wanted. but the reasonable price of this mobile as well as the cute look of it made it a great buy. educational baby products don't have to look weird!",positive

wicked widow: i can hardly wait for each new book by amanda quick to be published. am an avid fan. altho this one is not as good as some of her others. ie.mischief--affair still all in all her ladies all lend a breath of fresh air to the regency period. her love scenes are believable and her men are rather nice even when proven that they are not the answer to every maidens prayers. i like it when the bad and really bad guys get their just rewards. also the street children are treated with respect and kindness. all in all a good book.,positive
"some good content, hidden behind impossibly bad writing: a few helpful nuggets, strewn randomly across almost 000 pages of rambling natterings. comically poorly written book. seems like the author did some excellent research on a worthy topic, but then felt the key findings were too light to monetize, and decided to stretch a very finite set of insights and suggestions that could easily fit on a couple of pages across (multiple!) tedious filibuster books. it pleased me to see the cheap newspaper stock of this incoherent tome disintegrate in my fireplace.",negative

"this is great american literature at it's finest!: fortunately, fifteen years (or more) ago, i read this book on my own before my english teacher required it... this is not a book that needs to be analysed and charted. it is one that needs to be absorbed, and felt. it does not deserve to be one of those books students hate merely because it's required reading.the characters are as real as books get, the small town one that you might live in now, or your grandparents might have lived in decades ago. the issues - from racism, sibling relationships, and just plain growing up - touch your soul. and it's just plain fun to read.it's a bit of american culture that should be cherished... passed on as the valuable art it is - but to tear it apart with attempts to read into symbolism, or to over analyze it... that nearly denies harper lee the respect she deserves for writing it.",positive

"not adequate: bought these for my two adult chins. the male is tiny, but he was somewhat cramped in it and only used this until i added a fleece house - now he only uses this for a platform. it's also not heavy or stable enough for them to use as a platform - on shavings it will tip slightly and startle them when they jump on it. additionally, they jump on it with enough force that the top comes off daily, so eventually i had to nail it down so they wouldn't fall on it awkwardly.the female is much longer than the male, and she looked really uncomfortable in this whenever she had to turn around in it. she too abandoned it, and i didn't even give her an alternate nest box.i know the price is attractive, but now i have two houses that i'm going to pull out and replace with more substantial, large boxes. i definitely don't recommend this house type at all.",negative

"nice but a bit ""watered down"": ""rain"" is a classic pre-censorship movie of the 00's. as usual with this type of film, one must do a fair amount of reading between the lines to get the full story. joan crawford gives a strong performance as sadie thompson, a trollop on the run from the law. walter huston as alfred davidson, a bible thumping, over the top preacher, is sufficiently scary. the rest of the cast puts in fine performances. the cinematography is also exceptionally elegant.the story is a bit watered down from it's somerset maugham original, and some extreme leaps of believability are needed on the part of the audience to accept the denouement. but the story is strong and powerful and surprisingly up-to-date considering it is almost 00 years old. it would seem the religious right has been throwing its muscle around longer than we think.i highly recommend ""rain"", if for no other reason than to see joan crawford in the type of role that made her famous.",positive

"great show - dvd design lacking: if your a firefly fan buy it now. the shows are great, good sound, widescreen (fox never showed'm that way) and lots of the plot arc of makes sense (since fox showed them out of order so things were very strange). the only complaint is the quality of the dvd menus and such. the graphics just have a cheap feel and the selection 'bug' disapears into the background from time to time. not a fatal flaw, but glaring compared to the quality of the shows.the missing espisodes explain alot too - why irna was leaving at the begining of 'objects in space' (my fav) and more of mal and zoe's history. plus of course you get to see a real live alien (or is it.....)enjoy",positive

"scattered: this is a terrible book. yes, it provides you with a broad overview of the history of christianity, but it is scattered and badly organized. it gives focus to what seem to be some random movements, events, and beliefs in the christian history while neglecting others. it needs editing for consistency and to clarify run-on sentences and poorly illuminated points.",negative

"violets that need watering!: this story was a huge letdown! although, i'll admit, this started out to be a page-turner. which was fast-paced, gory, gruesome, and very intriguing. just the way i like em, so i thought. but, it didn't seem to want to slowdown, it kept right on going and going, leaving the ending rushed and lacking drama. the story completely dies. no suspense, what so ever, not a typical patterson novel. and, furthermore, to make things worse, in an effort to pick it back up, which, should've been another story altogether, we discover who's the mastermind. and, that also is a disappointment.",negative

"interesting life made less than interesting: there is no doubt that the man formally known as harry houdini led an interesting life. sprinkled throughout this book are reminders of such. and yet, the authors' compilation of all this facts contributes to this book's lack in interest. events and stories are not told chronologically, which wouldn't normally be a problem if there were some sort of other ordering system in place. instead, things appear to be thrown in haphazardly, making it hard to keep track of the many characters in houdini's life. relevance to time and situation are lost with this mish-mash of information. also, while the authors' attempt to humanize a biography is nice, their interposed dialogue proves distracting and a bit unbelievable. i would rather they had stuck to the facts, and presented them in some sort of order.the book is enjoyable only insomuch as houdini's life was fascinating. too bad the complete effects of this interesting life are lost within the puzzle of pages.",negative

"more of the same will not save us.: we consumed our way into our current mess and it is the height of folly to believe we can consume our way out of it. privatization (read commodification)is definitely not the answer. the reason the author comes to the conclusions he does is that it is just too difficult for him to give up his current lifestyle. showing us that recycling doesn't work is easy. recycling is what happens when we commodify something like garbage, so let's commodify everything and that will solve our other problems just as effectively. read 'divided planet' if you want a really well written book on the subject.",negative
0 years and still going!: i bought this from amazon a couple years ago. it still works great and i enjoy it very much. it is one of my favorite things. seeing those rainbows in the early morning (i have it in an east window) brightens the beginning of the day.i would think these rainbow makers would also be great for people who are bedridden or don't get around much. several elderly people i know have taken great delight in watching the rainbows move about their room.,positive
"enjoyable read if you can suspend disbelief: i enjoyed this book, but i still like stephen king's the stand better. the main reason is that the characters in swan song did not have enough depth. they were either ""good"" or ""bad."" i would have liked to see some of swan's bad traits and some of alvin's good traits, for example. very few people, if any, are either purely good or purely evil in real life, and i felt that this is where swan song lacked credibility. sometimes i actually felt like cheering for the bad guys because swan was just too sugary sweet. other than that, it was a decent book, worth reading.",positive

"take a nap: the first 00 minutes of this movie were rather amusing and after that it settled down to a real napper. endless long face shots of schimmer in particular looking concerned,pathetic,etc.,etc.made the film a test of one's staying power. occasional humor and the interest generated by paltrow and hersey helped,but the movie was unsavable.a 00 year old with his weird mother and bunk beds,paltrow's pathetic outfits and hersey,s atrocious hair and truly strange behavior are just a few of the blots on this would-be landscape. michael rappaport and that bitsy character trying to go over the top was also borderline offensive.as i review the film in my mind, two stars might have been too high! skip this one and enjoy an extra episode of friends.",negative

beats all others: with motor homes (and trucks) that have dual wheels it is critical that tire pressures be kept equal and at the proper psi. the milton s000 is the most accurate gauge i have ever used. its dual head is small enough to fit into the ports in the stainless wheel covers and makes it easy to reach the stem of the inside tire. you might pay a lot more for a gauge but you can't get anything better. the only down side is the size and weight. you won't be carrying it around in your shirt pocket.,positive

"not another fad diet: to all the critiques out there, this is not a fad diet. depriving people of the opportunity to read this book is depriving people of information that can make them healthier. this book does not claim to help you lose ""00 pounds by this summer !!"" it is a health program derived from biblical precepts and adopted to modern life. it has certainly helped me with my digestion problems and has given me the energy that i didn't have before i started with this. yes, organic foods are a bit more expensive and this diet does require a change of lifestyle, but hey...so does cancer and other diseases...so take your pick. it's about how to live healthier and prevent health problems in the future for you and your family.it has helped so many people, that there is a support group/community for ""maker's dieters"". <url>/",positive

"not star wars: this game represents the beginning of the end of the star wars franchise. it's not made by lucasarts and doesn't really have much to do with star wars at all.the game was not ready when i was beta testing it one month ago and i highly doubt that any of the critical bugs are fixed yet. this is a ""serious"" game which requires alot of repetitive work and a huge time investment.unless you are a student with nothing better to do all summer, don't buy this game. you need to invest at least 0 hours a day to be successful in the game.on the positive side, the combat system is alot of fun. going on a hunting expedition with a bunch of other players is cool. but the tedious portions of the game far outweigh the fun factor of combat.",negative
"anticlimactic: this novel started off just fine. i was quite interested in the story and quite anxious to follow it along.the characters were interesting; the plot was quite entertaining and suspenseful. in his usual style, dean koontz kept me wondering about what was going to happen.however, the ending was so disappointing. i felt robbed of my time and energy. maybe i have been spoiled by reading his more recent works first, but the ending left me staring at the page.definitely not one of koontz's better novels. he does have many more satisfying works.",negative

"even twilight has more bite than this: vampire boys has plenty of boys, but you would never guess that they are vampires. this movie is pretty dull stuff. even twilight was better. and the actor who played caleb was horrible. a lot of the dialogue was stilted, and there is very little action. i think the movie would have been more successful had it been called ""pretty boys"" instead. that's the point of this movie anyway. the point surely wasn't to entertain or to scare people. the only reason i'm giving this two stars instead of one is because there isn't an ugly person in the cast. that counts for something, right?",negative
"hostage to war-in the eyes of a prisioner: ""hostage to war"" gives a great understanding of the conditions that the prisions of forced labor camps and concentration camps went through. it is the true story of tatjana wassiljewa, who was 00 years old when the germans separated her from her mother and younger sister. she was sent off to a forced labor camp where she suffered horribly under hitler's vicious rule. she experienced things that are just mind boggling. starvation, illness, and so much more. it shows how hard it was to grow up during world war ii and survive. tatjana was a true survivor and went on to become a teacher during her twentys. it was an interesting book if you would like to learn more about world war ii.",positive

"great for hiring sales people as well!!: not only does this book explain many hunches i've had for decades (like who's full of baloney versus not) but it is also a great tool for recruiting sales people. after reading this i""ve discovered that the most likely successful sales people (for my company) are a) those that come from low income, distressed, or limited financial means rather than b) children of spoiled high income/high consumption families.i just fired someone that fell into the latter category when this book reaffirmeed she was never going to be successful.",positive

"good god, this sucked.: scott, keep walking, as far away as you can get from ever writing another book. you can't recap, your rants suck, and you get all pissy and whiny whenever anyone has a problem with anything you say or do. this is the worst book i have ever read, in any genre, including chyna's book. rantsylvania - we really do suck.",negative
the wachowski brothers really drop the ball with this one.: we waited this long for this? a movie that not only does not make a heap of sense but is a major let down in the most profound sense of the word. its seems to me that the wachowski brothers only concentrated on the special effects but forgot about writing a compelling plot to go with it. the mythology that made the first matrix such a classic is thrown out for an incoherent cyber juke of a story that not only insults the legion of fans but makes them look stupid for waiting around for theses sequels.the wachowski brothers should be a shame of themselves for ripping off the fans of the first movie.,negative
"it holds yer coffee!: yes, this carafe holds coffee, and does a superb job. but it can also store tea, hot water, soup, hot chocolate, marbles, you name it!i've purchased two of these now. my first one broke (it stopped keeping coffee hot), and the second one is for my wife. she likes to drink that crappy flavored coffee, and i don't want it tainting my italian roast colombian experience.",positive

"total rip off!!!!: i bought the 00 ounce version on ebay with free shipping for $00.00. i was expecting much more for the high price. the kleen kanteen is not insulated at all. if you put something cold in it, expect it to get warm really fast. if you put hot stuff in it (like me), expect it to get cold fast. expect to burn your fingers every time you pick it up. expect to burn your inner lip on hot metal ever time you take a sip. the steel is very thin. i expect that if i dropped it, it would certainly dent.this product is honestly worth about 0-0 dollars. if i bought it from their website for $00 and paid the high shipping cost, i'd be enraged when the product arrived. it's simply way too expensive.",negative

"0nd ed forgotten realms boxed set-better left in the box: just fyi: this review is for the 0nd edition boxed set, not the d&d0; hardcover.there is much to the old axiom of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it', and as cliche as it might be, it holds very true to the 0nd edition forgotten realms boxed set. oversized text and space wasting boarder art notwithstanding, the 0nd ed boxed set incorporates all of the nonsense of the 'time of troubles' trilogy of novels. it also adjusts the dale reckoning time line by almost a hundred years for no reason. it gives scant overviews of too large of an area, and almost nothing on the things that really matter, like characters, noble houses, and rivalries between states. it also brings out the worst of the realms, like munchkin characters such as drizzt du'urden and elminster. stick with the grey 0st edition boxed set, it's a much superior version.",negative
"have not read the book: i will admit upfront that i have not read nor will i read this book. but let me say this about r.c. sproul.he's a smart man with a good deal of natural intelligence but in many ways he has wasted his life by supporting a dying cause - calvinism.the reformed and presbyterian denominations in the u.s. are dying, and indeed are on their deathbed, and all of sproul's intelligence cannot nor will it change the reality of this dying heresy.calvin was wrong from the beginning and sproul was wrong to take his god-given mind and use it to try to prop up calvinism.i will say again, calvin was wrong from the start. the holy spirit is nowhere present in the writings of calvin anymore than he is present in the writings of sproul because the holy spirit is not the spirit of division and untruth.what a terrible waste, but this is what happens when your father in the faith is not jesus christ but john calvin.",negative

"nothing new: there is nothing new in this book. it was written to ""preach to the choir"", to cement pre-existing opinion rather than to present evidence and change minds. researched with a ""have a theory, we'll find facts to support this theory"" rather then any real scientific method. claims that god's marriage plan of one man, one woman was set in stone from the beginning of time, yet ignores that polygamy and use of concubines was god's rule of the day in the old testament. even if it were not poorly written, the thought process investing in this book is lacking.",negative

"not used to the used: i thought this cd needed a review from someone who had never heard the used before and wasn't comparing it to their previous albums. that would be me.the weak tracks on this album are the slower ones, ""find a way"" and ""smother me."" a few of the other tracks may be a bit poppy for some tastes (""with me tonight"" springs to mind), but they're musically solid.i have to agree it sounds a little overproduced, but i still enjoy it immensely and listen to it nearly every day.

"metheny is our mozart: while not my favorite pat metheny selections, certainly this vid will be much appreciated by metheny afficianados. watching how he makes his music is revealing, to see the facial expressions as his fingers work their magic, especially how his mouth moves - as if the sounds coming from his instrument were in reality coming from his very soul - grin - which of course, they are. a culmination of much of the life long theme that characterizes his work, which any pat metheny fan will instantly recognize, this piece is the pure essence of the man who is surely the mozart of our age.jonathan r. zylstra",positive

"working great so far: this type of humidifier works ultrasonically, which is very quiet and puts out a lot of moisture. the vibrating membrane that creates the mist does get clogged over time with minerals if you have hard water. it can be cleaned to a point, but eventually it might stop misting. you will find a fine layer of sticky mineral gunk all over the room (on any exposed surface), unless you have soft water. there are additives you can put in the water to minimize this. small rooms may get too humid unless it's on the lowest setting. we have been pleased with this one so far.",positive
historical drama: .....if you don't mind literary licence this is a pretty good story of the abolitionists and the pro-slavery forces that led to the civil war. raymond masey gives a dynamic performance as the fanatical john brown who wanted to free the slaves by inciting them to revolt......the movie also pairs errol flynn and olivia dehavilland for one of their many appearance together with the lovely miss dehavilland as the love interest of both flynn and ronald reagan with flynn emerging victorious......altogether it is an enjoyable film that combines history with fiction and a love story thrown in for good measure.,positive

"nice idea, but doesn't work: i agree with the person who tried this diet for 0 weeks, lost 0 lbs. the first week, then nothing else happened. that's exactly what happened to me! i started on january 00th (nine weeks ago) and i finally quit in disgust a few days ago. what was true is that you lose your food cravings during the day (i stuck to protein and vegetables/salad during breakfast and lunch.) what is not true is that your daily reward meal (usually at dinner) will enable you to lose weight. in other words, my food craving stopped, but i didn't lose weight! as a matter of fact, i started gaining weight in weeks two, three and four before again reversing. i agree in principle with everything said in this book (including the need to regulate insulin/blood sugar.) and if your goal is weight maintenance while eating anything you want (including pizza, chocolate, ice cream, and pasta) on a daily basis, then this book is for you. but you will never never never lose weight with this.",negative

"one of the all-time great westerns: ""shane"" is deservedly known as one of the great westerns.""shane"" is the story of a gunfighter who comes to the aid of a family of settlers who are being persecuted by free-rangers. there a many allusions to christ in the character of shane - his sensitivity, his serenity, his humbleness, his restraint, his self-sacrifice, even the fact he is only ever referred to by one name.shane is perfectly played by alan ladd matched by brandon de wilde as the young boy joey who idolizes shane, and jack palance is appropriately sinister as the ""bad guy"".""shane"" is superbly staged and shot with great use of foreground and background shot compositions particularly in the bar-room sequences - and who can forget the final sequence. this film more that any other mythologizes the western. a stunning achievement by director george stevens.",positive

"music: ok i understand everyone's point of view in thier comparisons between the stage production and the movie. i've heard both soundtracks. personally i prefer the newer one because i can relate to it. music was never about what notes a person can hit or how well trained they are. it is about the emotion it inspires. i don't feel as much in the original cast production. it just seems more realistic that the phantom should sound more seductive to express why christine would be torn between him and pretty boy. i really enjoyed gerry's singng because when he sang i knew how he felt. that's the point isn't it?i prefered emmy as well. sarah had a tendency to make the words less understandable in order to make her training more evident.i went and saw the movie almost a week ago and still have the music there, inside my mind.i definitly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the story and thinks the phantom should be dark and more mysterious than he was portrayed prevoiusly.",positive

"disappointing: let's face it. it doesn't take all that much to rewrite archetypal fairy tales. what takes talent is making something whole and new up out of the depths of the imagination. i find this trilogy sorely lacking on both points, the rewrite and the ""new"" aspects of the story.i guess the threshold is very low. sorry, can't recommend it. it's pretty on the cover, but the writing is stiff and not all that original.",negative

"attempted classic: this book is divided, almost arbitrarily into four sections- hook, pitch, clincher, close. a major theme is selling, and so one comes to wonder what the book is trying to sell you on. characters that are supposed to be endearingly innocent turn out to simply have no character development at all; a repetative and frustrating read.",negative

"a cohesive electronic statement: this album is a huge departure from the sea and cake's previous album, oui. on oui, the songs were very warm, the synthesizers were used to support the traditional rock instruments. on one bedroom, the songs, while still engaging, are more electronic and alien. the guitar steps aside for the synthesizer, and the drum machines seem to appear more than the drum set. the division between songs that center on more traditional rock arrangements and more electronic compositions is actually pretty equal. what's amazing is that the album is cohesive enough to make the instrumental songs flow seamlessly with the heavily electronic songs. not only do the songs flow well on this album, the cover of david bowie's ""sound + vision"" makes sense next to the original compositions. so, if you're interested in the chicago music scene, if you like electronic music, or if you're a fan of tasteful light rock, go listen to this album now.",positive
"not quite pink: i am a huge fan of the floyd, they're my favorite band, but i had trouble dealing with syd. i found his lyrics to be odd and tedious and lacking meaning. the album had no flow, the songs didn't blend, it had no direction. i actually found myself waiting for the album to end. syd's singing lacks melody and his guitar playing is no match for gilmours. this album was a valuable stepping stone, but nothing more.",negative
"excellent lost proto metal from south america: like flower travellin band, tarkus comes from a land that doesnt seem like it would have made an impact, but the power of zep and sabbath hit the 0 corners of the world. tarkus hailed from south america taking there name from the elp album (though sounding nothing like them). it is a great record of proto metal/doom with a zep/sabbath feel. the singing is all in spainish, which i only know a little, but it doesnt take away from the music. its almost poppy at times..but the guitar work and sound is awesome iommi-like. only 0 songs clocking in at just over 00 minutes..its too bad they never had anything after this..i would have loved to seen where they would have taken it. apparently there is still a version of this band sans the singer(who is in some religious cult) is still playing in south america..someone should record them too.",positive

"dated material, some over 00 years old: if you are looking for a topical discussion of technical and business writing, i think you can do better.that said, the book is a quick, informal, benign read. though it purports to be updated, some of the essays go back to the early 00s.some of the techniques discussed don't quite agree with the methods discussed in mike markel's ""technical communication"" or carolyn rude's ""technical editing.""if your instructor requires it for a course, buy it used. you'll likely sell it to someone else when you're done, as i will. it makes no sense to lose that much value on the resale.",negative

"not worth the wait: i can't believe it took 0 years for this. all i need is the best song on the cd but its all downhill after that. not sure who this album is supposed to appeal to, and by the looks of its success and availability, i guess not to many. most of you seem to like it so i am obviously the minority here. i am still a huge fan of songs he did with the doobies (i.e. nothing but a heartache, dedicate this heart, your made that way, losin end, etc.) and i liked if that's what it takes, but most songs on blue obssession are nothing more than easy listening music that's not so easy to listen to. the upbeat songs sound forced. on build upon it, which is a takin' it to the streets rip off, before the song even opens and sets a tone, its already in the chorus. if this was michael's first album, i would never buy his second.",negative

"well-acted but hard to understand: this movie has beautiful acting and cinematography but it is difficult to pick up the various threads and make sense of them, particularly if you are unfamiliar with the virginia wolfe novel, ""mrs. dalloway"". the movie centers around three women, virginia wolfe, played by a hard-to-recognize nicole kidman; an unhappy young housewife from the 00's, played by julianne moore; and a modern-day woman played by meryl streep. their stories interweave with one another and there are common themes of mental illness, lesbianism and unhappy women with death wishes. not exactly light entertainment! there were times when i wanted to tell the main characters to snap out of it and get on with life rather than wallow in the melancholy and self-pity which they display. this is a movie designed more for art than for entertainment, so be forewarned.",negative

"this so-called children's book is not really for children: i found this book rather sentimental and unsubtle, at least too much so for my taste. more importantly, i don't think this book is really for children. i don't think kids will relate to the father's emotion about his daughter, or simply may not perceive it: 'and he was smiling' may not be enough for kids. it doesn't help that the father is never depicted -- makes it harder still to identify with or understand this important character. and once the girl becomes a woman, i'm afraid that kids will feel very separate from her and so again not feel the deep emotion that many adults feel. this author has lots of fans, and many will enjoy the book no matter what, but in my opinion, as a children's book, it's flawed.",negative

"read this when baby is 0 weeks old: love her timeline (dropping night feeding around 0-00 weeks) and her forgiving spirit (if you've already missed that window, all is not lost, and you're not an idiot parent). i wish she'd be a little more explicit with her language sometimes. she rarely uses terms like 'cry it out,' but it is implied by statements like, 'let the baby work it out himself.' for someone not coming from a 'cry it out' approach, they might miss some of her helpful guidance because it is not direct enough.",positive
"i cant tell if this guy if naive, stupid or on the other team: what a lump of coal...written in a style that seems more interested in a company-centric style, this diatribe ode to corporate short sited bottom lines, takes a wishful thinking view on the wholesale and retail process of sending tens of thousands of jobs out of the country.the author gives brief lip service to the human tolls this process takes, always setting up a verbal best case scenario that includes more and better local jobs mystically appearing for the displaced workers this effects.hey tom, on the real world this process has led to double digit unemployment across the country. take a reality check and pull your head out of your 0th point of contact.congratulations to all the companies that have shaved a few points off the bottom line at the cost of their us former employees, and the long term well being of the country that sends out young men and women out to fight and die keeping you free.",negative
"if you hunger for more this book will satisfy: i wonder if kevin costner even realizes the artistic and historic contribution he has made with this film. as an artist i found this book to satisfy my graphic appetite and as a romantic i have, once again, been allowed to travel back in time. mr. costner has shown us his artistic brilliance in so many ways and i thank him for his efforts. enjoy the book; it is a treasure.",positive
"maybe good for health not for hair loss: i bought this product mainly because i wanted my 0 year old labrador to stop loosing his hair, because he really looses a lot. it's not like he is sick or anything, it's just the normal on this kind of dogs. i read this oil could help diminish the hair loss, but i don't think it does that. so, i would recommend ask a veterinarian if this product is good for your pet and what is the purpose of taking it.",negative
"great truly all-natural conditioner: i only use aubrey hair products because all of their ingredients are truly safe enough to eat. my hair is thick, wavy/slightly curly, and tends to get frizzy. i use this conditioner at my gym because they use hard water and this one works best there. i've tried the other ""dry hair"" products and the island naturals and white camellia left my hair too soft or oily and i didn't like the smell of the desert herb as much as i like the honeysuckle rose. i use the gpb conditioner at home because i have soft water there and the honeysuckle rose can make my hair too soft. a recommendation - if you have problems selecting a shampoo and conditioner, bear the water hardness in mind and try several, especially if you shampoo at more than one place. thank you aubrey for developing and producing such wonderful products!",positive

historical fiction about baseball in the 0000s in japan: i really enjoyed this book. the only thing i would change is to move the historical information from the end of the book to the front of the book. i had no idea this novel was historical fiction until after i had finished reading it.i purchased extra copies to give to my baseball/softball playing grandchildren.,positive
creative travel dock 000: what a great little product! bought it to take on vacation and i wowed my sisters with the sound. i have a bose sound dock for home but wanted a portable dock. could not believe such a tiny speaker system (fits in my tote bag) produced a very big sound. well worth the money and am so glad i purchased it.,positive
"pedagogy of a genius: paulo freire is one of the unsung heros in the field of education. here he is again, writing such terse sentences that they have to be re-read several times to absorb all their nutrients. just like his brilliant pedagogy of the oppressed, education for critical consciousness is an antidote to the current u.s. crisis of ignorance and consumer-insanity.",positive
a thought provoking book: this book will leave you examining what's important in life. i found myself wondering what our family would do in such a situation. it is humbling to think the lord is in control of it all and we're to seek and do his will. there was a brief mention of 0/00/00. i felt it was tasteful and appropriate. it happened such a few short years ago and is part of our history. let us not forget that tragedy while we let our mind wander and wonder: could something really cause a power outage over the entire earth? how would we survive?,positive
"excellent series but .....: stories and acting of the highest caliber. unlike most tv dramas today, it is difficult to anticipate/predict the outcome of these stories. full of surprises and generally more realistic cold war spy thrillers than contemporary shows.the only reason for four stars instead of five is the disappointment that a&e; decided to show the british introduction instead of the johnny rivers ""secret agent man"" song that opened the show for the us audience. it helped set the tone for the show. i guess a&e; thought the british audience was bigger than the us audience - hmmmm: i wonder what they use when they think.",positive

"a nice game yet homers are too common: this game is a really good game, except that homeruns are too common. also, the scoring is high. once, i was detroit and the computer was tampa bay. the pitcher was wilson alvarez. in the 0st inning i scored 00 runs. also in the same inning 0 players hit homeruns all in a row. (i traded for some of these players) ken griffey jr.,sammy sosa, bob higginson, mark mcquire, mike piazza, and deivi cruz hit 0 run homeruns all in that order. in that game i won 00-0!! what was that about??? the graphics are great. in homerun derby i was mike piazza the computer todd helton. i scored 00 homers and helton scored 0 homers.another thing i hate is that i can crush homers off of randy johnson, pedro martinez, but i can't crush off of mike magante! it's crazy. everything else is grreattt!!!!!",positive

"here - here! on the lousy mastering complaints: poor mastering sums it up! not a trade mark example of the rush sound quality we have all come to know and love. cd companies need to be paying way more attention to sound quality details - especially considering what they expect us to pay for the final product. furthermore, rush themselves should be paying more attention and frankly i am surprised they let this one out the bag in the over modulated state that polutes all the exciting tracks. digital technology isn't what's it cracked up to be folks. don't let the cd companies get away with this bs - contact them and demand quality.",negative
"tubular bird cage stand: the bird cage stand works as i hoped it would. the problem is that it has scratches all over it. since each section of the stand was still wrapped in paper, when it arrived, i do not think this damage happened during shipping. because the cage stand is so scratched up, i will not order from that place again; nor will i recommend them to anyone else.",negative
"the titans are back: in this comeback of the teen titans, starfire invites the teen sidekicks of the dc universe to reform the teen-powered super team. as expected with teen sidekicks, they are all anxious to get out of the shadows of their mentors. of course if the teen titans return, their nemesis deathstroke will show up. in fact, the battle between the teen titans and deathstroke is the highlight of this book as the young heroes pit their skills against the wily mercenary. surprisingly, the teen titans also go up against the jla! since wonder girl joined the titans without wonder woman's approval, wonder woman shows up to enforce her wishes. of course it gets out of hand, and the two teams support their members. teen titans: a kid's game is a fun read, and is recommended to fans of the teen titans.",positive
"not a good film for children.: if you were an adopted child, this was not a good experience. you go back through time, and it is the only chance you will have to see your mother. to turn away at the last minute, you have pined for this moment your entire childhood. the whole concept stinks!that bouncing around with very little plotline also stinks!",negative

"kind of creepy: i give it 0 stars only because it was free. the illustrations are poor, and the 'poems' are pretty awful. it says on the back cover, in all caps,""what goes around comes around"" i think that's pretty creepy for a preschooler's book. clearly this is a 'traditional' family values kind of book, and doesn't come across as being very accepting. in it's favor is that it is easy to read, and the concepts are very clear, though sometimes a little weird.",negative

"it was a good book with many funny parts in the story.: the story is overall a great book to read, but if you expect 00 people to read the book, i will bet that not all of them would read it willingly. i read it, but i know that i would not finish it if it hadn't for a grade or a requirement in school. the story have become more interesting from chapter 0 and on, but the chapters before that seems like it would take forever to read through it.",positive

"frindle by d00: do you like books that you absolutely cannot put down? then frindle by andrew clements is the book for you! this book is about a boy named matt who has to do a homework assignment about how the words in a dictionary were made. while he is doing the report, he learns that words are just made up for no particular reason, so he makes up his own his own word instead of a pen he calls it a frindle. after a few weeks, the whole town is saying the word. i liked this book because it is funny and realistic. this book would be better for people under thirteen because i don't think people over thirteen will think it is funny. i say that because it will only take adults about 00min. to read this book. since the kids will take longer to read the book they will understand it better. to really enjoy this book you have to read it slowly. i highly recommend this book for you.",positive

"completely useless in chicago but great in la: i should have paid attention to earlier reviews. i activated the subscription, set it to show any type of event and in 0 weeks driving routes around chicago metro it has sat there. the icon says it is apparently active and yet it has not shown a single warning. it has set routes down freeways the same radio station says are stationary and nothing. totally useless.took it to la, with the traffic kit as it does at least provide a good charging stand!!. guess what it was picking up alerts and acting on them within 0 minutes although the traffic status display was identical to what i see in chicago where it has never received anything.",negative
"adorable!: everyone fell in love with this costume. it was nice and warm for the rain and snow we had that night. the only problem i had with it was that the huge collar never wanted to stay up, so people had to ask what he was. as soon as i held it up, they knew exactly what he was supposed to be. i tried ironing it, but it didn't help. i think it was just layed down too long the wrong way in the package. other than that it was great. most people loved how original it was for such a small age. my son looked majorly snazzy in it! i almost wish the cape could come off so he could just wear the suit around because he looked so cute in it!",positive

"simple and works fine.: these are best suited for hanging as shown, rather than floors or flat surfaces (imho). mine worked well in my tests and is a bit louder than some. decent value for the price, i think. this design is a bit different than most others and well suited for hanging on a tub or basin (or whatever) to prevent overflow. can also be used for leak detection, but the wire is very stiff, so in some situations the simpler, ""just sit it down on the floor"" designs are easier to use. but this is better if you need to feed the ""detector"" into an enclosed area or pan.",positive

"just a tad too messy.: i started reading this with a completly open mind to a new writer and a new style, but i really just could not get into this book. it felt rushed, dry and a little messy.the plot was moving along so fast i could not keep up with it. the characters weren't introduced well and i didn't really feel anything for them. the romance did not seem real to me and the sex scenes were about as dry as the characters themselves. the story bounced around so much i really just could not get myself sucked into it.overall i certainly did not care for this book, but in no way am i saying this to disrespect the writer. i have only the utmost respect for any author, no matter what i think about the book. and this in no way turns me off from reading one of her other books if one catches my eye.",negative
"yet another repackage of ""feak out"": this is just another repackage of the toronto 0000 concert which has been bootlegged and released without alice's involvement under dozens of titles. apparently, the ""science fiction"" title is an attempt to cash in on the other new release, brutal planet. buy this if you're a completist and don't have it under one of the other titles.you'd think that by now, the record companies would have excised those two songs by the uncredited opening band...",negative

"should be the first of a new series!: i was surprised that this mystery-thriller was so well written. nikki hill has great promise as a continuing character, as do several others in the story. interesting plot and the da office setting could even be expanded.i'd like to know how much was written by darden & how much by lochte.",positive
"pleasant and recommended reading (but plot could be better): the elegant writing and the well-paced daily life of the main character in this book make for a pleasant, rewarding reading. the descriptions of places and people are very nice.it's good to learn that ron ely, after gracing our tvs in tarzan stories, produced a nice written work like this.i found the plot a bit weak, and it shows especially at the end. i would have given the book 0 and a half stars, if that was possible.",positive

don't waste your time!: i don't know what the point of this book was. it took 000 pages to develop the so called 'mystery.' i knew i should have stopped reading but all the reviews had said what a good writer this author was. i stuck with it and now regret doing so. this is a very simple book with a lot of things that need to happen in a cetain way and of course they do. the characters seem to be living in the 0000's even though this takes place in current time. they all are naive people. this is my second book by this author and i will not make the mistake of reading a third book! you shouldn't either.,negative

"feminist propaganda that goes nowhere: once again, too bad zero ratings aren't allowed.this movie is just another piece of feminist propaganda from the late 0000s that regurgitates the usual anti-male spiel and has nothing of any substance to offer. the fact that the ""heroine"" sort of wanders off the screen at the end is most telling. she has her ""individuality"" and that's about it. george harrison's song ""i me mine"" should have been playing in the background at that point.blecch.",negative

"terrible colorization: this version of the movie on vhs is not recommended for collectors. the movie is colorized, apparently by a kindergartener with crayons. blotches of pink and orange for faces and a torch which burns with green, orange, and yellow flames are evidence that the colorizing process was done in a haphazard manner with no concern for the quality of the job. the movie itself is quite good although i personnaly prefer the richard chamberlain version. 0 stars for a really bad print of a good movie.",negative

better than a diaper bag: i use this instead of a diaperbag. it holds more and i can organize things better so i don't have to dig around for what i need. the only complaint is that it seems like the fabric jansport uses doesn't seem as sturdy and thick as it used to be. we'll see how it holds up.,positive

the perfectly named film: this film is so much fun i didnt want it to end. amy adams is transcendent in her role as the princess to be giselle. she shouldve gotten an oscar for this performance. for me it is one of the most enjoyable and delightful performances ive seen in a long time.i had to practically be forced to watch this film since it seemed on the surface like a kids film i didnt want to see. i was wrong. it is a film for everyone. it is funny and touching and has scary moments and great singing and dancing and its a beautiful film to behold in every way.i loved this film.,positive

"truly gnarly: ""gnarl!"" is the companion volume to ""seek!"" and probably one of the best story collections i've ever read. featuring almost the entirety of rucker's professional short-story output, ""gnarl!"" includes hysterical and visionary pieces reminiscent of authors ranging from kurt vonnegut to bruce sterling (whose collaborative effort ""big jelly"" is featured here alongside gems co-written with marc laidlaw and paul de fillipo). as far as collections go, ""gnarl!"" is becomingly introspective, and can be read as a transrealist autobiography. rucker creates grim futures and funny scenarios that cover the spectrum of human emotion. pac-man addiction. religious fervor. microgravity sex. beatniks and hydrogen bombs. time warps and deranged aliens. ""gnarl!'s"" got it all. you can't come away from the experience unmoved.",positive
"great headphones. great value.: i think these have got to be the best headphones for the money out there. i've had mine about a year and an super pleased with them. from great sound, great comfort, i am very happy. i mainly got them to use on flights where i was sick of the engine noise breaking in to the music. i had been using some over ear headphones, but needed something smaller. much smaller. enter these sony's.i will concur with one review i read below - the rubber that houses the wires broke down on my and exposed the wires. annoying, for sure, but i'm just getting another pair. it took them a year and a half of daily use for this to happen, so i am not concerned.",positive

"miracle in maryland: the chesapeake bay area surrounding annapolis is a wonderful place to live. the author of this medical fantasy story describes local neighborhoods and live experiences with focused accuracy. there is much to learn about piloting an airplane that is revealed by the author's vast knowledge of that subject but the relevance to the whole story escaped me. perhaps, one must rise above all the details on the surface of the earth to see the whole picture and make such a seemingly simple but amazing medical discovery. the greatest asset of this book is to remind readers that helping mankind is much more important than the potential monitary reward associated with an invention or a discovery. the second most important asset of this book is the pure learning experience about historical facts from a very learned author.",positive

"dim and disappointing!!: what a waste of money. this is not an led light, and does not come close to the performance of an led light at half the price! guess we're paying for the name and the lifetime warranty. this one will easily last a lifetime, sitting unused in a drawer. bought it for my medical career wife (she likes purple) but it is clumsy for her to turn on, concentrate the beam, then turn off with one hand. bought her a 00-cent tear-drop shaped keychain led light on a whim and its perfect. brighter and easier to use, replaceable battery, and 0/0 the cost. i really expected more from this company, but both this light and their customer perspective are obsolete. no complaint with the quality of construction. solid aluminum and o-rings as usual. just has the minor flaw of casting a weak and scattered beam, way below the performance of modern led technology. the light is yellow and full of shadow artifacts that prevent a clean illumination. not a good buy; don't repeat my mistake!",negative

"musical kleenex: joss stone's a decent singer, but shouldn't be writing songs; or releasing them. i couldn't find a single memorable tune here. i also thought her singing was too flamboyant, but perhaps it's to keep up with the heavy production, which is so overcooked it's insufferable. next time joss should try losing the rappers and the big beat overkill. as one critic wrote, ""sometimes it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew."" i couldn't agree more. this album is like musical kleenex, use it, then lose it. better luck next time.on the other side of the coin, there's ""the orange album"" by stefy (rae) which is a stunning debut. had gwen stefani made it, journalists would have called it a pop masterpiece. it's new artists like stefy that could keep the music business afloat. are we listening ms. stone.",negative

"replacement straps for old lamp: the price was good and delivery excellent. the reason for buying this item is my old straps are looking like failure could be imminent.always be prepared. ps: this is a simple design that kicks the behind. a creative guy can build his own mounting system for a number of things with these straps. for me, it was an elevated head lamp for use with a works enduro rider steering dampener.",positive

"00th anniversary: for a long time, there wasn't a lot of asia video out there. then came some bootlegs, then the music videos and concerts in russia and europe. finally....a concert that spans the entire musical careers of all the members!!! it is so nice to see and hear songs from yes, king crimson, elp, and even...the buggles. for me, the highlight was asia doing a monster version of ""fanfare for the common man"". the band truly seemed to enjoy the variety of material, as well as all the classic asia songs. would have liked to see ""go"" played, but that is covered in other collections. i like steve howe, but pat thrall actually did a nice job in his asia stint. palmer is palmer....the king! downes is a creative force, and wetton has been one of my favorite vocalists since the 00's. asia fans....this is a must buy!!!!!!!!!!!!",positive
"a helpful, well laid out book: theodora philcox has created a very helpful book on the still life. there is a wide range of styles and several very fine artists. philcox takes the artists' own explanations of their techniques and adds some of her own helpful comments and observations. styles of art are juxtaposed giving the reader a good view of different approaches to their art. of special interest is the work of artist timothy c. tyler whose realistic and brushy artwork steals the show.",positive
"best dance album for 0000: i bought a lot of dance, trance, electronic, cd and this is my favorite album for 0000. very good beat and vocal. a good choice for club hits fan...",positive
marketing at it's worst: it is fairly well known that many fans of the show are not little kids. as such how can this outrage continue what is the point of releasing a dvd without a widescreen format? i won't even buy this mockery of a release. they release b-horror movies in widescreen so why not the powerpuff girls movie?,negative
"disappointing.....: i'm very disappointed in this product. it was difficult to calibrate, and not very accurate once i did get it calibrated. it lasted only a few months. my advice: spend more than ten bucks on a meat thermometer.",negative
"scary: i also had a scare with my 00 month old that woke up at 0 am crying hysterically b/c she was trapped under the ultimate crib sheet, however i also realized that she would likely not suffocate because the fabric is a high tech breathable fabric that prevents suffocation. however, we still removed the crib sheets.",negative
"worth the money!: this mat is definately worth the extra money. i practiced yoga five days a week for 0 months, blowing out one cheaper mat and causing significant signs of wear on the second one. once this mat is broken in, i found it to not only be quite sticky, but also to provide excellent cushioning for me knees. it is also larger than most other mats, so there is less need to read just your position on the mat as frequently to avoid contact with others in a crowded yoga class.this mat is also excellent for those wanting to practice yoga at home on carpet. my other mats always slid around on my carpetted floor, but this one is heavy enough to stay put. if you are committed to a yoga practice, invest in this mat and you won't regret it. the only negative is that it is so heavy i would not necessarily recommend it to yogis that walk or bike to class.namaste!",positive
"accurate and durable weight: this is an accurate and durable weight. i have read numerous articles about free weights being off. i weighed mine and they were accurate. the only thing that kept them from getting five stars is that they are on the bulky side likely due to the neoprene coating. i am female 0'0"" with long thin fingers. if my fingers were not on the longer side it may be hard to grip these well. they work for me, but i would be careful if you have tiny hands.",positive
"ncv audio review: while this cd set is in a very nice carrying case with a magnetic clasp, and the sound is clear, unfortunately the background music (with an ocassion drum beat etc) is distracting, and, and for me personally, the person narrating it has a 'southern preacher' sound that i don't care for. if you prefer a southern preacher reading this and background music then you will really enjoy this. i'm used to alexander scourby with no music/dramatization, so this was a let down for me.",negative
"the best cheap stereo: the design is nice, the mechanics a little awkward, the tape drive is funky, and the remote is flimsy but the sound, oh, my, the sound is wonderful. it's far better than my $000 sony and better overall than any other stereo that i've owned.i know, i know, it's hard to believe a $00 stereo sounds great but this one does. try it in the store, if you can. i'm not sure how or why it sounds so much better than everything else available for less than $000 but it does.",positive
worst plot ever: the writer is trying to make an issue between the main characters so that they have that perfect moment where she realized he is the most important. give me a break. write some good movies and step out of the box of writing the same plot all the time.,negative
"oye: i thought that this would be a great little camera to show off my new house before and after. well i was wrong. first the batteries run out constantly and second, the software is not compatible with xp. this is not helpful. i guess that the adage you get what you pay for applies here.",negative
"a must-read for the budding geographer: i'm working on my phd in geography. this was a required text for a first-year graduate seminar on ""history and theory of geography"". this book gives a biographical sketch of numerous recent luminaires in geography. the book is easy to read because it's broken down into nice nuggets of information about a specific geographer and makes mention of how their work relates to other geographers also in the book. granted, it's not comprehensive, but it does give a good foundation in the theories behind modern geography.if you are into geography (with a capital-g) and not just geography, buy this book. even if you don't read it right away, it'll find a comfortable spot on your bookshelf.",positive
"vince vaughn!!: vince vaughn should be pete tyler! keanu reeves might be okay, too, but vince vaughn would be better. john cusask already played the guy in 'high fidelity' who was a loser, by the way, and pete tyler is much cooler and better boyfriend material. everyone should read this book 'cause it's great and then write vince vaughn and tell him to do the movie!",positive
"best western ever: gritty, dirty and downright manly. the overgrown adolescents of today need to study this film and learn how to act like a man. no tattoos, ear-rings or other piercings to smother the y gene. little music is used; some of the 00s and 00s flicks were embellished with over the top, histrionic scores combating rather than complimenting the plot. the dialogue is short, cutting and to the point. i especially like the ""he-girl"" comment. another william wellman masterpiece; get this film. dvd transfer is superb.",positive
"pretty but poor quality: the handle on the kettle is not connected very well and allows for a lot of ""bounce"" when you are lifting the kettle, traditionally instability is not something i look for when poring boiling water. also, when you lift the lid you need to lift it from the top of the kettle and then immediately move it to the left or the right, since there isn't enough clearance (b/c of the handle) to remove the lid naturally.the color is nice and they did a nice job on the ombre effect. i expected more from le creuset.",negative
"excellent presentation of efforts towards peace: this documentary was co-produced and directed by israelis and palestinians. it presents an in-depth view of efforts by people from both sides toward mutual understanding. full of stories that we should all hear, but don't. a must-see for anyone interested in peace in the region.",positive
"this coffeemaker rules!: if you truly enjoy great coffee, this coffeemaker is the one! i have never tasted such good coffee made in someone's home and rarely even at fine restaurants. i feel like i'm at starbuck's everyday even when i don't grind my own beans. i almost bought the regular mill and brew and i'm so glad i waited and got the carafe minus the heating element. you may have to tweak the coffee to water ratio but be patient grasshopper - it is so worth it!",positive
"not for newbies: want to know how to stop a movie from looping? not here. how about getting transitions to run smoothly? nah.if you haven't a clue what director is about - walk away; this book will not help you. it assumes much too much of the reader. on the other hand, once you have some idea of the director paradigm and have made a movie or two, then i would add this to your bookshelf.",negative
"i'll stick with house: although laurie did grab me from the beginning and take a wild ride, i soon lost interest in the book. i don't know if it was the cast of characters showing up after a 000 page hiatus or if it was just way the story was being told. eventually, i sent down the book and never finished it.",negative
clever and easy: very clever layout and easy to understand recipes. the beautiful photos make a snap to imagine cooking these things yourself. highly recommended!,positive
"fantastic: i just got these and opened them about 00 minutes ago. i was a bit unsure about getting them, what with the 0 star reviews, but i thought what the hell and took a chance. i have to say i am glad - 0 star reviewers must have strange ears as as well as being comfortable, they have a great sound. i am on pretty low volume and i can't hear the keys as i type. the design is great - they fit fine, and they are almost unnoticable.",positive
"a good book!: i think this book is a all right type of book. i know life has its struggles, but there is nothing worth running away from. i believe it was a couldn't keep the book down group, but i believe nothing is worth running away from.",positive
"best iron on the market: this iron cuts my ironiong time in half. it is easy to use, outperforms every iron i've ever used, and makes the task of ironing fun and rewarding. what other small appliance can you say that about?",positive
"the first professional packaging book i have: i have looked and analised the book, and compared with the peppin press books, this book is all you need to learn and study packaging design.this book will teach me and maybe you how we can design packaging.all cash deserved",positive
"the best choice i think: the same work conducted by klempeler with philharmonia orchestra is famous. but i promise this live recording is better and it's the best one i've heard(including walter,bernstein,rattle,mehta,kaplan and other klem's one). klempeler's reading is insightful and the bavarian radio symphony orchestra played so warm and powerful that i think it is better than the philharminia orchestra especially for its brass. the remastering of this disc is succesful,the sound is more rich than other version. though there's several cough-sound,it's never mind.i'll give it 0 star if i could.",positive
good history: very informative and well written. when i started reading this i had no idea how exciting cereal was. it is very comparable to the personal computer revolution of the 0000s. a true history of americana that seems to been forgotten in our times (0000).,positive
